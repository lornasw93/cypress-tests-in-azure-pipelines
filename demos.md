# Demos

I have included several short demos below in gif format for ease of viewing but have also attached an MP4 copy with each demo description in case wanting to watch more carefully.

### Ability to create bugs from a failed test run result
I have selected a failed test run and attempted to create a new bug. You can view more info on the error too as well as the stack trace. You are also able to add to an existing bug. [MP4 version 🎥](/assets/demo/fail/create%20bug.mp4).

### View artifact video
I have selected a successful test run and viewed the video artifact the pipeline was able to generate. [MP4 version 🎥](/assets/demo/success/view%20artifact%20video.mp4).
