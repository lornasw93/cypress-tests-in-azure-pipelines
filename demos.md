# Demos 🔥

I have included several short demos below in a GIF format for ease of viewing and have also attached the equivalent MP4 copy with each demo description with this icon > 🎥, in case wanting to watch more carefully.

### 1. Ability to create bugs from a failed test run result [🎥](/assets/demo/fail/create%20bug.mp4)

I have selected a failed test run and attempted to create a new bug. You can view more info on the error too as well as the stack trace. You are also able to add to an existing bug and associate tests to a work item.

I have selected a successful test run and viewed the video artifact the pipeline was able to generate.
