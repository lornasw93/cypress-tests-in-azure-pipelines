# Demos ðŸ”¥

I have included several short demos below in a GIF format for ease of viewing and have also attached the equivalent MP4 copy with each demo title with this icon > ðŸŽ¥, in case wanting to watch more carefully.

### 1. Create bug from a failed test run result [ðŸŽ¥](/assets/demo/fail%20-%20create%20bug.mp4)

I have selected a failed test run and attempted to create a new bug. You can view more info on the error too as well as the stack trace. You are also able to add to an existing bug and associate tests to a work item.

### 4. View analytics [ðŸŽ¥](/assets/demo/analytics.mp4)

At pipeline level, you can view analytics for the test runs which can be very useful, for instance, if wanting to find out which tests are failing the most.
