# Demos 🔥

I have included several short demos below in a GIF format for ease of viewing and have also attached the equivalent MP4 copy with each demo description with this icon > 🎥, in case wanting to watch more carefully.

### Ability to create bugs from a failed test run result
I have selected a failed test run and attempted to create a new bug. You can view more info on the error too as well as the stack trace. You are also able to add to an existing bug. [🎥](/assets/demo/fail/create%20bug.mp4).
